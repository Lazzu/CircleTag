# CircleTag
A library to generate and read circular tags. Designed to transfer small amounts of data from a phone to another via phone screen and camera. An example use-case could be connecting in-game friends by displaying a tag on one phone and reading it with another.
## Project state
Prototype version. I am currently improving the reader to detect the input more easily.
